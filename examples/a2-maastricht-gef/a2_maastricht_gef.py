    # GEF Data for A2 Tunnel Maastricht

    This notebook demonstrates how to 

    1. Read in Ground Investigation (GI) data from [GEF files]() using [pygef](https://cemsbv.github.io/pygef/)
    1. Use `bedrock-ge` to convert that data into a standardized GI database using `bedrock-ge`
    1. Transform the GI data into 3D spatial features with proper coordinates and geometry ([OGC Simple Feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features))
    1. Explore and analyze the GI data using interactive filtering with Pandas DataFrames and interactive visualization on a map with GeoPandas.
    1. Export the processed GI database to a GeoPackage file for use in other software, like QGIS.

        <summary>What are GEF files?</summary>
        <p>
            <abbr>Geotechnical Exchange Format (GEF)</abbr> is a standardized, text-based format designed to facilitate the reliable exchange and archiving of geotechnical investigation data, particularly CPT results, across different organizations and software platforms. GEF can also be used for other types of soil tests and borehole data. It is widely used in the Netherlands in ground investigration.

        <summary>What is a DataFrame?</summary>
        <p>
          A DataFrame is like a spreadsheet, it is a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a table with rows and columns.

    ## Context

    The Koning Willem-Alexander Tunnel is a double-deck tunnel for motorized traffic in the Dutch city of Maastricht. The tunnel has a length of 2.5 kilometers (lower tunnel tubes) and 2.3 kilometers (upper tunnel tubes).

    The tunnel has moved the old A2 highway underground. This highway previously formed a barrier for the city and slowed traffic.

    ### Geology

    The uppermost layer consists of topsoil, clay, and loam, with a thickness of about 2 to 4 meters. These soft Holocene deposits are attributed to the Boxtel Formation, laid down by the Meuse River, as the tunnel is situated in a former river arm.

    Beneath the surface layer lies an approximately 8-meter-thick gravel deposit. This gravel acts as a significant aquifer and was a key factor in the groundwater management strategies required for the tunnel construction.

    Below the gravel lies a fissured limestone layer belonging to the Maastricht Formation (mergel). This layer is a very weak, porous, sandy, shallow marine limestone, often weathered, and includes chalk and calcarenite components.

    The limestone is relatively young and shallow, resulting in low compaction and cementation. Its mechanical strength is highly variable and generally low, especially when saturated with groundwater.

    Extensive geophysical surveys and borehole investigations were conducted to map the subsurface, identify faults, flint layers, and assess the risk of cavities within the limestone. While faults were detected, no significant cavities were found.

    The stability of the excavation pit was monitored in real-time, with groundwater levels and pressures carefully controlled to prevent collapse or excessive deformation of the pit walls.

    Due to the high permeability of the gravel and fissured limestone, groundwater management was a major challenge. Over 500 wells were drilled to depths of up to 32 meters for dewatering, and a reinfiltration system was implemented to return nearly all pumped water to the ground, protecting local buildings and ecosystems.

    ## Converting multiple GEF files to a relational database

    Rather than dealing with a folder of files, we would like to combine all files into a single database with spatial information. This is where Bedrock comes in.

    ### Relational Databases

    A [relational database](https://observablehq.com/blog/databases-101-basics-data-analysts#what-are-relational-databases) is a database with multiple tables that are linked to each other with relations. This type of database is ideal for storing GI data, given its [hierarchical structure](https://bedrock.engineer/docs/#hierarchical-nature-of-gi-data).

    In Python it's convenient to represent a relational database as a dictionary of DataFrame's.

    ### Coordinated Reference System (CRS)

    First, let's check in which projected coordinate system the provided data was recorded.
